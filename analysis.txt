This project was a ton of fun. I really felt that using NEAT along with 
Pygame was a great way to learn a lot about reinforcement learning and 
AI. I think for the purposes of this project NEAT was the right choice.
The goal for this racer was to make a program that would learn to drive, 
and with NEAT we had the ability to use track fitness per evolution 
inspired algorithm. From my undestanding NEAT isnt able to work with 
enviornments that are complex or challenging. Since we have a static map
NEAT is doing just fine and pumping out generations. If we were to use another 
similar program it would be the Q-Learning algorithm. Anything else would
be overkill for this project since our project was very simple.
